#### 1. Fast

#### 2. Attractive (UI and UX)

Most users engage with the attractive page, for example, Apple displays its latest products with beautiful mockups, good design, and font.

As we all know that all users are in a hurry therefore they don't care about your product until the given information makes sense and gives clarity to them.

With Good SEO, your website is not worth it. Doesn't matter whether it has good functionality, Responsive Design, or Fast until your website ranks good among other websites, or shows on google search results. I know these are also important after users find your website. Good SEO makes your website stand out from other similar websites from example; if I search for free coding tutorials, most probably the freeCodeCamp result will pop out first.

#### 4. Responsive Design

Responsive web design (RWD) or responsive design is an approach to web design that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.

Responsive Web Design uses HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge a website to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).

#### 1. Use of Semantic HTML
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".) Example of Non-Semantic Elements: `<div>`, and `<span>` and Semantic Elements: `<h1>`, `<form>` and `<table>`

#### 2. Type Readable Code, Use of Comments
MIT Professor says: Programs must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute. How you should write comments, "Just like you're explaining your code to someone else who might do not know to code, or you are watching your code back after 2 years". 

#### 3. Clear Navigation
When a user visits they first look at a navigation bar, the navigation bar should be clear responsive and have all the associated links. Use simple language in the navigation bar TIP: Use buttons instead of large text they may look better, in case you have so many links

#### 4. Follow Colour Palette
Colour Palette represents your brand strongly. Think like big brands, such as Instagram, and Twitter how they use the same color everywhere. The best way to choose your website's color palette is with branding. 

#### 5. Compress Images, and Videos
Image with good quality and lower size make your website more attractive and fast. Keep in mind that images and visuals are better than text in terms of user experience, and design. Always prefer to use .png format if your image is transparent, and .jpeg format if your images are normal.
